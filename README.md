## HyperSnapSDK Documentation for Android

## Overview

HyperSnapSDK is HyperVerge's documents + face capture SDK that captures images at a resolution appropriate for our proprietary Deep Learning OCR and Face Recognition Engines.

The framework provides a liveness feature that uses our advanced AI Engines to differentiate between a real user capturing his/her selfie from a photo/video recording.

The framework also includes optional Instructions pages for Document and Face capture and a Review page for Document capture.

## Example Project
- Please refer to the sample app provided in the repo to get an understanding of the implementation process.
- To run the app, clone/download the repo and open **sample** using latest version of Android Studio
- Open project build.gradle and replace **aws_access_key** and **aws_secret_pass** with the credentials provided by HyperVerge
- Set **appId** and **appKey** in the `HyperSnapSampleApp.java` class
- Build and run the app

## Integration Steps

### 1. Adding the SDK to your project
- Add the following set of lines to your `app/build.gradle`

  ```groovy
  dependencies {
      implementation('co.hyperverge:hypersnapsdk:3.0.0@aar', {
          transitive=true
          exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms'
          exclude group: 'co.hyperverge', module: 'hypersnapsdk-instructions'
          exclude group: 'co.hyperverge', module: 'hypersnapsdk-qrscanner'
          exclude group: 'co.hyperverge', module: 'hypersnap-pdfconverter'
      })
  }
  ```
  Please note:
  1. If you would like to use the instructions module, please remove the exclude statement for `hypersnapsdk-instructions`
  2. To use the QR Scannner module, please remove the exclude statement for `hypersnapsdk-qrscanner`
  3. To get PDF versions of the captured documents, please remove the exclude statement for `hypersnap-pdfconverter`
  4. If you would like to use location information from the EXIF data of the image, please remove the exclude statement for `com.google.android.gms`
  5. If your app is still compiling at Android versions below 28, please replace 'co.hyperverge:hypersnapsdk:3.0.0@aar' with 'co.hyperverge:hypersnapsdk:2.5.16@aar'. Although HyperSnap v2.5.16 supports apps compiling at Android versions 26 and 27, it is being deprecated in the coming months. There will be only bug fixes and no new features added to this version. Please contact HyperVerge for more details.

- Add the following set of lines to the Project (top-level) `build.gradle`

  ```groovy
  allprojects {
      repositories {
          maven {
              url "s3://hvsdk/android/releases"
              credentials(AwsCredentials) {
                  accessKey aws_access_key
                  secretKey aws_secret_pass
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  where **aws_access_key** and **aws_secret_pass** will be provided by HyperVerge

- (Optional) We recommend enabling minification and proguard to lower the app size. Add the following lines to the `android` section of the `app/build.gradle` file. FInd more about proguard [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code).
  ```groovy
	buildTypes {  
	    release {  
	        minifyEnabled true  
	        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
	  }    
    }
  ```
- (Optional) We recommend installing Android NDK in the system generating the final APK. This is to ensure a low size footprint. Learn more about NDK [here](https://developer.android.com/ndk).

### 2. Update Proguard File
  If you have a proguard file, add the following to it:
  ```
  -dontwarn  co.hyperverge.**
  -keepclassmembers class * implements javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory {
         private javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory delegate;
    }
```

### 3. Initializing the SDK
To initialize the SDK, add the following line to your app before calling any of the SDK functionalities. For example,  you can add it to the `onCreate` method of the application class.
  ```java
  HyperSnapSDK.init(context, APP_ID, APP_KEY, region);
  ```
Where,
	- appId, appKey are given by HyperVerge
	- region: This is an enum, `HyperSnapParams.Region` with three values - `AsiaPacific`, `India` and `UnitedStates`.

Please note: The SDK requires **Camera** and **Autofocus** permissions to capture images.
    Camera permissions will be handled by the SDK if not already handled by the app.

### 4. Launching the Activities

Both Document Capture and Face Capture happen via Activities provided in the SDK. The activities are called 'HVDocsActivity' and 'HVFaceActivity' respectively. To add them to your app:
    1. Set config parameters
    2. Create a completion callback
    3. Call the `start` method of the corresponding Activity

#### For Document Capture

  ```java
  //1. Set properties
  HVDocConfig hvDocConfig = new HVDocConfig();
  hvDocConfig.setDocumentType(HyperSnapParams.DocumentType.card)
  hvDocConfig.setShouldShowReviewScreen(true);
  hvDocConfig.setDocCaptureTitle("ID Card")
  //2. Create Completion Callback
  DocCaptureCompletionHandler completionCallback = new DocCaptureCompletionHandler() {
  @Override
  public void onResult(HVError error, JSONObject result) {
        if (error != null) {
            //Handler Error
        }
        if (result != null) {
            //Handler Results
        }
    }
  };
  //3. Call start method
  HVDocsActivity.start(context, hvDocConfig, completionCallback);
  ```
  where:
  - **context**: is the context of the current Activity being displayed.
  -  **completionCallback**: is an object of type `DocCaptureCompletionHandler`. It is an interface that has one `onResult` method that will be called incase fo success and failure. The `onResult` method has 2 parameters.
	  - **error** : Object of type `HVError`. Explained [here](#hverror) . If the process was successful, this object would be null.
	  - **result** : JSONObject. It has the `imageUri` of the captured image.
  - **hvDocConfig**: This is an object of type `HVDocConfig`. Its properties can be set with the setter methods provided for them. These are the various setter methods provided:
    - **setDocumentType**: (Document) Document is an enum of type   `HVDocConfig.Document`. It specifies the aspect ratio of the document that needs to be captured. Its default value is `CARD`. The parameter can be initialized as follows:
        ```java
        Document document = Document.CARD;
        ```
      - Following are the document types supported by the Document enum:
           - **CARD**: Aspect ratio: 0.625.
              Following documents require `CARD` aspect ratio:
				- Driving License
		      - Aadhaar Card (India)
		      - PAN Card (India)
		      - National ID (India)
		      - MRC (Vietnam)
          - **PASSPORT**: Aspect ratio: 0.67.  This is for Passports.

	          - Bank statement
	          - Insurance receipt
	          - EVN (Vietnam)
          - **OTHER**: This is for aspect ratios that don't fall in the above categories. In this case, the aspect ratio should be set in the next line by calling `document.setAspectRatio(aspectRatio);`
    	    Following documents require `OTHER` aspect ratio.
		    - Voter ID (India) (here, set aspect ratio to 1.4)

    - **setShouldShowReviewScreen**: (Boolean) To determine if the document review page should be shown after capture page. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setShouldShowInstructionPage**: (Boolean) To determine if the instructions page should be shown before capture page. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setShouldShowFlashIcon**: (Boolean) Setting this to true will add a flash toggle button at the top right corner of the screen. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setShouldAddPadding**: (Boolean) Setting this to true will enable extra padding that will be added to all images captured using the Document Capture activity. It defaults to `true`.
    -  **setDocCaptureTitle**: (String) To set the title text that is shown in the document capture page.
    - **setDocReviewTitle**: (String) To set the title text that is shown in the Review screen after a document has been captured.
    - **setDocReviewDescription**: (String) To set the instruction text that is shown in the Review screen after a document has been captured.   
     - **setDocCaptureDescription**: (String) The text displayed at the top section of the Camera Preview in HVDocsActivity. This is to communicate the positioning of the document to the user.

    - **setDocCaptureSubText**: (String) The text displayed at the bottom end of the Camera Preview in HVDocsActivity. It is meant to tell the user about the document type.


#### For Face Capture

```java
//1. Set properties
  HVFaceConfig hvFaceConfig = new HVFaceConfig();
  //2. Create Completion Callback
  FaceCaptureCompletionHandler completionCallback = new FaceCaptureCompletionHandler() {
  @Override
	  public void onResult(HVError error, JSONObject result, JSONObject headers) {
		  if (error != null) {
			  //Handler Error
		  }
		  if (result != null) {
			  //Handler Results
		  }
	  }
  };
//3. Call start method
  HVFaceActivity.start(context, hvFaceConfig, completionCallback);
  ```
  where:
  - **context**: is the context of the current Activity being displayed
  - **completionCallback**: is an object of type `FaceCaptureCompletionHandler`. It is an interface that has one `onResult` method that will be called incase fo success and failure. The `onResult` method has 3 parameters.
	  - **error** : Object of type `HVError`. Explained [here](#hverror). If the process was successful, this object would be null.
	  - **result** : JSONObject. It has the `imageUri` of the captured image. If the liveness call was successfully performed, it will have the entire results of the liveness call.
	  - **headers** : JSONObject. If the liveness call has reached the HyperVerge servers, this object would have the headers returned by the server. Otherwise, it will be null.
  - **hvFaceConfig**: This is an object of type `HVFaceConfig`. Its properties can be set with the setter methods provided for them. These are the various properties provided:
    - **setLivenessMode**: (HVFaceConfig.LivenessMode) Explained [later](#Liveness-in-Face-Capture).
    - **setShouldShowInstructionPage**: (Boolean) To determine if the instructions page should be shown before capture page. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setFaceCaptureTitle**: (String) It allows to modify the title text that is shown in HVFaceActivity.
    -  **setLivenessAPIHeaders(_ headers : [String:String])**  : Any additional headers you want to send with the Liveness API Call. Following are headers that could be sent.
        -   _referenceId_: (String) This is a unique identifier that is assigned to the end customer by the API user. It would be the same for the different API calls made for the same customer. This would facilitate better analysis of user flow etc.
    -   **setLivenessAPIParameters(_ parameters : [String:AnyObject])**  : Any additional parameters you want to send with the Liveness API Call. Following are parameters that could be sent.
        -   _enableDashboard_: (String - "yes"/"no") If you want to access HyperVerge's QC dashboard, set this to 'yes' so that the information from the API calls are made available to the dashboard.
	    -   _allowEyesClosed_:(String - "yes"/"no") If this is set to 'no', a error would be thrown when eyes are closed in the user photo. By default, closed eyes are allowed.

#### Liveness in Face Capture
The `HVFaceConfig.LivenessMode` enum takes two values.

**.none**: No liveness test is performed. The selfie that is captured is simply returned. If successful, the result JSON in the CaptureCompletionHandler has one key-value pair.
- `imageUri`: local path of the image captured.

**.textureLiveness**: Texture liveness test is performed on the selfie captured.  If successful, a result JSON with the following key-value pairs is returned in the CaptureCompletionHandler.

- `imageUri`: String. Local path of the image captured.
- `result`: JSONObject. This is the result obtained from the liveness API call. It has 3 key-value pairs.
    - `live`: String with values 'yes'/'no'. Tells whether the selfie is live or not.
    - `liveness-score`: Float with values between 0 and 1. The  confidence score for the liveness prediction. This score  would only be required for debugging purposes.
    - `to-be-reviewed`: String with values 'yes'/'no'. Yes indicates that it is flagged for manual review.

For more information, please check out the [API documentation](https://github.com/hyperverge/validation-india-rest-api)


#### APICompletionCallback
APICompletionCallback is an interface whose object needs to be passed with `makeOCRCall`, `makeFaceMatchCall` or `makeValidationAPICall` . It has one `onResult` method that contains the error or result obtained in the process.

Following is a sample implementation of APICompletionCallback:
  ```java
  APICompletionCallback completionCallback = new APICompletionCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(HVError error, JSONObject result, JSONObject headers) {
        if(error != null) {
            //Handler Error
        }
        else{
           //Handle Result
        }
    }
  }
  ```  
  Where,

 - **result**: The result JSONObject is the entire result obtained by the API without any modification.
 - **error**: It is a HVError Object. Explained in [this](#hverror) section.
 - **headers** : JSONObject. It is the headers returned by the HyperVerge servers.

## QR Scanner
The SDK provides a QR Scanner activity with a UI and implementation logic similar to the face and document capture activities. To integrate it, please use the following code:

	 QRScannerActivity.start(context, new QRCodeCompletionHandler() {
		 @Override
		 public void onResult(HVError error, JSONObject result) {
			 if(error != null){
				 //Handle Error
			 }
			 if(result != null){
				 //Handle Result
			 }
		 }
	 });
Please note: To use the QR Scanner, make sure that the following line is not present in your `app/build.gradle` file:
`exclude group: 'co.hyperverge', module: 'hypersnapsdk-qrscanner'`

## HVError
HVError is the error object returned in case of failure in Face Capture, Document Capture, makeOCRCall or makeFaceMatchCall.

It has two variables : `errorCode` and `errorMessage`. These can be accessed with the following method:
```
int code = hvError.getErrorCode();
String message = hvError.getErrorMessage();
```

Here are the various error codes returned by the SDK.

|Code|Description|Explanation|Action|
|-----|------|-----------|------|
|2|Internal SDK Error|Occurs when an unexpected error has happened with the HyperSnapSDK.|Notify HyperVerge|
|3|Operation Cancelled By User|When the user taps on cancel button before capture|Try again.|
|4|Camera Permission Denied|Occurs when the user has denied permission to access camera.|In the settings app, give permission to access camera and try again.|
|5|Hardware Error|Occurs when camera could not be initialized|Try again|
|6|Input Error|Occurs when the input needed by the start method/HVNetworkHelper method is not correct|Read error message for more details|
|11|Initialization Error|Occurs when SDK has not been initialized properly|Make sure HyperSnapSDK.initialise method is called before using the capture functionality|
|12|Network Error|Occurs when the internet is either non-existant or very patchy|Check internet and try again. If Internet is proper, contact HyperVerge|
|14|Internal Server Error|Occurs when there is an internal error at the server|Notify HyperVerge|
|22|Face Detection Error|Occurs when a face couldn't be detected in an image by the server|Try capture again|
|23|Face not clear Error|Occurs when face captured is blurry|Hold the phone stead while capture|
|31|Instructions Module Not Included|Occurs when `setShouldShowInstructionPage` is set to true but the instructions module is excluded in gradle|Remove the exclude statement from gradle|
|32|QR Scanner Module Not Included|Occurs when there is an attempt to use the QR Scanner but the module is excluded in gradle|Remove the exclude statement from gradle|


Apart from the above errors, if the server returns a non 200 status code for any of the API calls (Liveness, Face Match, OCR or Validation API), the status code is as it is returned as the error code and the corresponding message is returned as the error message.

These are the possible error codes that could be received from the server:

|Code|Description|Explanation|Action|
|-----|------|-----------|------|
|400|Invalid Request|Something is wrong with the input|Check the error message/API documentation|
|401|Authentication Error|Credentials provided in the initialization step are wrong|Check credentails. If they seem correct, contact HyperVerge|
|404|Endpoint not found|Endpoint sent to makeFaceMatchCall or makeOCRCall is not correct|Check API documentation|
|423|No supported KYC document found|Happens only in makeOCRCall|Capture again with the correct document and ensure good image quality|
|429|Rate limit exceeded|Happens when the number of API calls per minute has exceeded the rate limit|Contact HyperVerge to revise the rate limit|
|501, 502|Server Error|Internal server error has occured|Notify HyperVerge|
|503|Server Busy|Server Busy|Notify HyperVerge|

   - In order to customise font, border color, text size, text color different styles are used within the TextViews. The style names can be used in the parent app to change the properties.   
   - [Calligraphy](https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy) library is used to load the fonts from assets folder.
   - **styles.xml**:      
        - **The following style is used by all the title texts in the SDK.**
            ```xml
                <style name="TextViewHeader">
                    <item name="android:textColor">@color/title_text_color</item>
                    <item name="android:textSize">18.7sp</item>

        - **The following style is used by all the content description texts in the SDK.**
             ```xml
                 <style name="TextViewContent">
                   <item name="android:textColor">@color/content_text_color</item>

            ```
### EXIF Data
Both Face and Document images returned by the SDK have EXIF data stored in them.
If the app has permissions to access location, the EXIF data would also contain the 'GPS' data of the image.
Please note that, if GPS data is needed, location permissions should be handled by the app before launching the SDK.

To get the EXIF data, use the following code on the `imageUri` returned by the SDK
 ```
    private void extractExifData(String imageUri) {
        ExifInterface exif = null;
        try {
            exif = new ExifInterface(imageUri);

            String make = exif.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_MAKE);
            String model = exif.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_MODEL);
            String flash = exif.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_FLASH);
            String focalLength = exif.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_FOCAL_LENGTH);

            extractLocationData(exif);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private void extractLocationData(ExifInterface exifInterface) {
        float[] latLong = new float[2];
        float latitude = 0;
        float longitude = 0;
        boolean hasLatLong = exifInterface.getLatLong(latLong);

        if (hasLatLong) {
            latitude = latLong[0];
            longitude = latLong[1];
        } else {
            Log.w(TAG, "No latitude and longitude present in the image");
        }
    }
 ```
